When the customer expressed concern about the verification code being sent to the old phone, the agent acknowledged and offered to send it to another number on the account (00:02:06). The agent confirmed details multiple times to ensure accuracy, such as verifying the phone number, IMEI, and insurance (00:03:34, 00:05:10). The agent also used the customer's name and reassured them during the process, ending with a friendly closing: \"thank you so much for being part of acades family\" and \"have a wonderful day\" (00:06:42, 00:06:53).",
      "reasoning": "The agent demonstrated active listening by clarifying ambiguous statements, apologizing for errors, and confirming details to avoid mistakes.

The agent confirmed the phone number multiple times, requested the full name, sent a verification code, confirmed receipt of the code, asked for the IMEI number, confirmed the SIM card usage, requested the 8-digit PIN, confirmed insurance details, and verified the phone was working after the SIM switch. The customer\u2019s concerns about switching phones, SIM card usage, insurance cost, and phone functionality were all addressed.",

The agent took the necessary steps to facilitate the phone switch, including verifying identity, sending and confirming a verification code, collecting device information, confirming insurance, and ensuring the new phone was operational.

      "evidence": "At 00:01:20, the agent says, \"Oh, okay. My bad. I'm sorry.\" This is the closest to an empathy statement, but it is a generic apology rather than a situationally relevant empathy expression. There are no other statements acknowledging the customer's potential frustration or difficulty during the call.",
      "reasoning": "Throughout the call, the customer mentions switching phones and waiting for verification texts, which could be moments of potential frustration or confusion. However, the agent only offers a generic apology once when asking for the phone number again, without explicitly acknowledging the customer's feelings or difficulties.
