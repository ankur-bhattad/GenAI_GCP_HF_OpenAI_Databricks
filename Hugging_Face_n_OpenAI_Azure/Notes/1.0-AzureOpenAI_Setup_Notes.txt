1.Authentication using API Key
For OpenAI API Endpoints, deploy the Model to generate the endpoint URL and an API key to authenticate against the service. 
In this sample endpoint and key are strings holding the endpoint URL and the API Key.

--Basic code example
import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

endpoint ="MyEndPoint"
model_name = "gpt-4.1"
deployment = "gpt-4.1"

subscription_key = "<your-api-key>"
api_version = "2024-12-01-preview"

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version=api_version,
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_key=subscription_key,
