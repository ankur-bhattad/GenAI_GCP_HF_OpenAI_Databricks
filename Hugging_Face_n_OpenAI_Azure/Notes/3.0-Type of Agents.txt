Common AI agent types :

#1️: Single (Basic) Agent

	One model, one goal, no special structure.
	You give a prompt → it responds.

	Example:
	“Summarize this article.”

	Use cases:
	--Q&A
	--Writing
	--Simple analysis

	Limitation:
	No planning, no memory, no tool coordination.

#2: ReAct Agent (Reason + Act)

	An agent that thinks step by step and uses tools while reasoning.
	ReAct = Reasoning + Acting

	(loop):
	Think: What should I do next?
	Act: Call a tool (search, calculator, API, DB)
	Observe result
	Repeat until done

	Simple example:
	Task: “What’s the weather in Paris and should I carry an umbrella?”

	Agent:
	Think: I need weather data
	Act: Call weather API
	Observe: “Rain expected”
	Think: Answer user
	Act: Respond

	Use cases:
	--Web search agents
	--Data lookup
	--Tool-heavy tasks

	Strength:
	Handles real-world info
	Weakness:
	Slower, can loop if poorly designed

#3: Tool-Using Agent

	An agent with access to external tools, but not necessarily full ReAct reasoning.
	Examples of tools:
	Calculator
	Code interpreter
	Search engine
	File system
	APIs

	Example:
	“Analyze this CSV and plot a chart.”
	The agent:
	Loads file
	Runs code
	Produces output

	Difference from ReAct:
	Tool-using ≠ step-by-step reasoning loop
	ReAct is a structured pattern of tool usage

#4: Planner–Executor Agent

	The agent splits work into planning and execution.
	Planner: creates a plan
	Executor: carries out steps

	Verifier (optional): checks results
	Example:
	Task: “Build a marketing report about usage of llm in different continents”
	Plan:

	Research market(europe, asia. north america..)...combine..
	Analyze competitors
	Create summary
	Format slides

	Executor runs each step.

	Use cases:
	--Long tasks
	--Projects with dependencies
	--Business workflows

	Strength:
	More reliable on complex tasks
	Weakness:
	More overhead

#5: Reflex Agent

	Acts immediately based on rules or patterns, no deep reasoning.
	Example:
	If email contains “urgent” → notify user
	If server CPU > 90% → restart service

	Use cases:
	--Monitoring
	--Alerts
	--Simple automation

	Strength:
	Fast
	Weakness:
	Not flexible or intelligent

#6: Memory-Augmented Agent

	An agent that can store and retrieve memory beyond the token limit.
	Types of memory:
	Short-term (current context)
	Long-term (vector DB, files, notes)

	Example:
	Remembers your preferences
	Remembers project decisions
	Retrieves past conversations

	Use cases:
	--Personal assistants
	--Long projects
	--Customer support bots

	Key benefit:
	Avoids “forgetting” in long tasks

#7: Multi-Agent System

	Multiple agents, each with a role, working together.
	Common roles:
	Planner
	Researcher
	Coder
	Critic / Reviewer
	Manager / Coordinator

	Example:
	Task: “Write a research paper”

	Agent 1: Research sources
	Agent 2: Draft content
	Agent 3: Check facts
	Agent 4: Edit and polish
	They communicate with each other.

	Use cases:
	--Complex reasoning
	--Large projects
	--Simulating teams

	Strength:
	Higher quality, specialization
	Weakness:
	Costly, coordination complexity

#8: Hierarchical Agents

	A boss agent that controls worker agents.
	Structure:
	Manager agent → assigns tasks
	Worker agents → execute
	Manager → reviews & combines results

	Example:
	Manager:
	“Research, coding, testing needed”
	Workers:
	Research agent
	Coding agent
	Testing agent

	Difference from multi-agent:
	Clear chain of command
	Less peer-to-peer chaos

#9: Autonomous Agent

	An agent that:
	Sets sub-goals
	Executes repeatedly
	Runs until stopped

	Example:
	“Improve my website SEO every day.”

	Agent:
	Analyzes site
	Proposes changes
	Implements updates
	Repeats

	Use cases:
	--Continuous optimization
	--Monitoring systems
	Risk:
	Needs strong constraints to avoid runaway behavior.

#10: Human-in-the-Loop Agent

	An agent that asks for human approval at key steps.
	Example:
	Agent drafts email
	Human approves before sending
	
	Use cases:
	--Legal
	--Finance
	--Healthcare
	--High-risk automation

	Strength:
	Safe and controllable
