# GenAI_DataBricks_GoogleCloud
> 🚧 This repository is constantly being refined and improved. Stay tuned!

> 🚧 In the Process of re-arranging code examples and notes for clear seggregation, 
-  so as of now some additional clicks :) [7-Feb-2026]
    

My exploratory work on AI/GenAI 
- Google AI/APIs
- Databricks Platform
- HuggingFace/Transformers
- OpenAI/Azure AI

and integration with distributed search platforms such as ELK, OpenSearch, Vector stores(DBs)

> 🚧 When looking in folders, look in Notes/*.txt files for instructions or explainations and then use *.py/*.ipynb files from Sample_Codes.
> Remember to install packages(in main env or virtual env) to test codes examples or use Colab-notebooks from Google Cloud
