The key is to divide the balls into groups and use the results of the weighings to narrow down the possibilities. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\\n\\n### Step 1: Initial Grouping\\n1. **Divide the 12 balls into three groups of 4 balls each**: Let's label the balls as A1, A2, A3, A4 (Group A), B1, B2, B3, B4 (Group B), and C1, C2, C3, C4 (Group C).\\n\\n### Step 2: First Weighing\\n2. **Weigh Group A against Group B**:\\n   - **Case 1**: If the scales balance, then the odd ball is in Group C (C1, C2, C3, C4).\\n   - **Case 2**: If Group A is heavier, then the odd ball is either in Group A (and heavier) or in Group B (and lighter).\\n   - **Case 3**: If Group B is heavier, then the odd ball is either in Group B (and heavier) or in Group A (and lighter).\\n\\n### Step 3: Second Weighing\\nNow, we will analyze each case separately.\\n\\n#### Case 1: A = B (Odd ball is in Group C)\\n3. **Weigh C1, C2 against C3, C4**:\\n   - If they balance, then the odd ball is not among C1, C2, C3, or C4, which is impossible since we know one is odd. So, this case will not occur.\\n   - If C1, C2 is heavier, then one of C1 or C2 is heavier, or one of C3 or C4 is lighter.\\n   - If C3, C4 is heavier, then one of C3 or C4 is heavier, or one of C1 or C2 is lighter.\\n\\n#### Case 2: A > B (Odd ball is in A or B)\\n4. **Weigh A1, A2, B1 against A3, A4, B2**:\\n   - If they balance, then the odd ball is either B3 or B4 (and lighter) or A1, A2 (and heavier).\\n   - If\",\n",
